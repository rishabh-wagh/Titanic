# Titanic

In this, I used the Titanic dataset provided on Kaggle to predict the survival of passengers.
I performed EDA and visualized the outputs for better understanding of the dataset and after cleaning the dataset I used following machine learning algorithms for prediction :
  
  * Logistic Regression
  * K-Nearest Neighbours
  * Gaussian Naive Bayes
  * Linear Support Vector Machines (SVC)
  * Stochastic Gradient Descent
  * Decision Tree Classifier
  * Gradient Boost Trees
  * CatBoost Algorithm
  
I determined the accuracy of these algorithms using cross-validation and chose the best algorithm for prediction
